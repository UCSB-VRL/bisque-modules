Intakes a ``*.nii.gz`` file and returns back a segmented scan, using a ResNet patch-based method.

## Usage

1. Select an ``*.nii.gz`` file from Bisque (you will need to upload it first if it is not already present).
2. Run the module.
3. Results will be returned as an ``*.nii.gz`` file -- this can be viewed directly, or downloaded if desired.
