<h1>Poisson to Sparse</h1>
<p>Image enhancement approaches often assume that the noise is
signal independent, and approximate the degradation model as zero-mean
additive Gaussian. However, this assumption does not hold for biomedical
imaging systems where sensor-based sources of noise are proportional to
signal strengths, and the noise is better represented as a Poisson process. In
this work, we explore a sparsity and dictionary learning-based approach and
present a novel self-supervised learning method for single-image denoising
where the noise is approximated as a Poisson process, requiring no clean
ground-truth data. Specifically, we approximate traditional iterative optimization algorithms for image denoising with a recurrent neural network that
enforces sparsity with respect to the weights of the network. Since the sparse
representations are based on the underlying image, it is able to suppress
the spurious components (noise) in the image patches, thereby introducing
implicit regularization for denoising tasks through the network structure.
Experiments on two bio-imaging datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of PSNR and SSIM.
Our qualitative results demonstrate that, in addition to higher performance
on standard quantitative metrics, we are able to recover much more subtle
details than other compared approaches. Our code is made publicly available
